        <h1 id="one">ARDIUNO BASED 2D CNC PLOTTER</h1>
    </CEnter>
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p> A drawing machine is not much more than a CNC machine. More specifically a CNC router 
        with an attached writing utensil, rather than a cutting tool. This particular application is an 
        open-source project by BCN3D Technologies, which anyone can replicate for themselves. The 
        parts can be 3D printed using FDM printers. Robot arms are an essential thing to learn for any 
        engineering students looking get into the manufacturing industry. Today robots are employed 
        in virtually all manufacturing and assembly processes. They do the job which are hazardous, 
        strenuous, or too difficult for humans</p>

    <h1>Pin Discription</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> VIN : The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. </li>
        <li>5V : This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin 35 of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board.  </li>
        <li>3V3 : A 3.3 Volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50mA. 
        <li>GND : Ground pins.  </li>
        <li>IOREF : This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3. </li>
        <li>IOREF : This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A               properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3.V. Memory. The ATmega328 has 32 KB (with 0.5 KB used for the bootloader). It also has 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM. </li>
            <li>Input and Output: Each of the 14 digital pins on the Uno can be used as an input or output, using pin Mode(), digital Write( ), and digital Read( ) functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull- up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 k ohms</li>
            <li>AREF :Reference voltage for the Analog inputs. Used with Analog Reference</li> 
            <li>Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and Transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to- TTL Serial chip. </li>
            <li>External Interrupts: 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attach Interrupt () function for details. </li>
            <li>PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the Analog Write () function.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>CNC machines can be used continuously 24×7 throughout the year and only need to be switched off for occasional maintenance. </li>
        <li>CNC machines are programmed with a design which can then be manufactured hundreds or even thousands of times.</li>
        <li>Each manufactured product will be exactly the same. </li>
        <li>Less skilled/trained people can operate CNC machines unlike manual lathes / milling machines etc. which need skilled engineers.</li>
        <li>CNC machines can be updated by improving the software used to drive the machines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>DisAdvantages</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The machine runs in a slow pace and generates excess heat which causes the heat sink to be heated quickly. </li>
        <li>A slight error may remain on the image file after it has been plotted due to one side of the Y-axis fixed to the moving mechanism and the other end is free to move.  </li>
        <li>The Z-axis is not very rigid so it causes slight vibration. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It is used to plot the PCB (Printed Circuit Board ) Layout.</li>
        <li>CNC cutters are usually used to describe logos or lettering and cut them out of the foil correctly.</li>
        <li>The healthcare industry requires CNC micromachining of small segments from different materials for life saving matters.</li>
        <li>Consumer electronics i.e. The Apple MacBook and its various models aluminium body is made using CNC.</li>
